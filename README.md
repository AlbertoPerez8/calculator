# Calc.py

Python program made to run on terminal capable of doing single operation calculations.
Possible operations program can run are as follows:
  
  Operation - *Format*
  
  * Addition               *a + b*
  * Subtraction            *a - b*
  * Multiplication         *a * b*
  * Division               *a / b*
  * Exponentiation         *a ^ b*
  * Square Roots           *sqrt(a)*
  * Sine                   *sin(a)*
  * Cosine                 *cos(a)*
  * Tangent                *tan(a)*
  * Exponential function   *e(a)*
  * Logarithms base 10     *log(a)*
  * Natural Logarithm      *ln(a)*
  
In addition to the mathematical operations, there are several other commands
  - clear -> clears the terminal
  - exit/close -> terminates program
  - clear history -> resets operations history
  - last -> returns last operation along with value
